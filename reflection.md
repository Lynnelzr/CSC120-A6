- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I think Inheritance makes my programming process more convinient since I don't need to repeat some codes in every class.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I met some problems when creating hashtable but then I figured them out after google the use hashtable format. 
I would suggest others who take this course to find an example of inheritance and learn from it to apply to our codes. For example, I learned from the one card example.
